        <p>
          Some of us have family and friends who may have japa’d from your home
          country in Africa. Japa’d, is a Nigerian slang for “migrated out for a
          better life abroad”. Good thing is that they still think of us back in
          Africa and want to express some love and support to us by sending us
          some money. However, this process of sending money to African
          countries can quickly become stressful.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're reading this blog, it means you have possibly searched the
          internet on the smoothest, fastest, and safest methods to either
          receive money or transfer money internationally. That's why I prefer
          straitPay, but before I tell you why I have decided to stick with that
          platform, here are five things to know about international money
          transfers.
        </p>
        <h2>Verify Your Recipient Details </h2>
        <p>
          There is nothing as irritating as sending money to the wrong account.
          It often takes forever to get your money back. As such, you need to
          verify that the beneficiary's bank details or phone number (if paying
          with Mobile money) are correct before you make your international
          money transfer.
        </p>
        <h2>Watch Out For The Exchange Rate</h2>
        <p>
          Exchange rates and transfer fees change constantly, and this will
          usually affect how much your beneficiary receives. You should keep an
          eye out for the best rates and not always be lured by the zero fees
          advertising message.
        </p>
        <h2>Fintech or Banks?</h2>
        <p>
          This is going to be a real battle. Do I go to the bank, a secure,
          brick-and-mortar institution often licensed and heavily regulated or
          get a digital finance service provider from my mobile application
          store? Here me out, Fintech apps have their pros and cons, just like
          any other method or idea in the world including banks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Banks may be safer but do they provide the best rates? Are they
          stress-free, easy to use and fast? Digital financial service providers
          are getting popular these days and they are also required to be
          regulated to offer a money service business. Therefore, you should
          always ensure that any Fin-tech app you consider has its license and
          approvals from the regulator. That way, you can report if you suspect
          any problems with your transaction.
        </p>
        <h2>Avoid Payment Transfer Scams </h2>
        <p>
          Like my mother would say, “where there is a brain to create money,
          there is another planning to scam you out of the money.” When making
          an international money transfer, you have to be careful not to fall
          victim to scams
        </p>
        <p>You can spot the likelihood of a scam by looking out for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If anyone requires your login details in order to assist you in
            making an international money transfer.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            If anyone requests for you to transfer money through an unreliable
            means.
          </li>
          <li>
            If they ask you to provide your card details to anyone you do not
            know or trust.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            If they ask you to give a large amount of cash to someone who will
            payout to your beneficiary.
          </li>
        </ul>
