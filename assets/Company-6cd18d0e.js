Ironically, it allowed us to reach for the pause button, to take a moment, and ask ourselves why? For a lot of us, “why” was about varied personal matters that touched you and me. Why am I in this job, why don’t I explore the world more, why don’t I appreciate my family more, and a myriad of other topics. For those of us at straitPay and our founder Kele, it was also a time of reflection and deeper conversations, especially around sub-Saharan Africa, notably its economic and developmental challenges. Why couldn’t we take a more direct role in the lives of our loved ones back home, why couldn’t they access health care as readily as Western countries, why couldn’t we invest in our future at the click of a button, why was sending money (remittance) seemingly the only ever answer? straitPay quickly recognised the lack of a smooth financial connection between Africa and Europe, the lack of easily accessible companies, existence of complex protocols, and confusing rules. So, we set out to do something different, believing that there is a better way to interact with Africa beyond just remittances. We decided to create a platform that would make it simpler and more efficient to send your money, invest your money, or spend your money in Africa, on the things that matter to you as an African in a way that works for Africa. In Kele’s words “spending, investing, and interacting with Africa should be easier and more enjoyable, especially because we’re putting back into the motherland”. When you use straitPay, you are choosing a platform that meaningfully connects you to Africa, and shows the world how special Africa truly is! Our story doesn’t end here, it’s only the beginning, one we’d love to have you write with us, and maybe together we’ll all find our answer to the question “why” Welcome to the straitPay family, the journey has only just started ……..
